## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

Was good to learn about how the viewport heights and widths work a bit more in tailwind

### Continued development

Just a practice project but having it as a reusable component as part of a larger project would be cool
